## Database Migration with Prisma

Prisma is used in this project to manage database migrations. Follow these steps to create and apply migrations:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Prisma CLI installed. You can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g prisma
```

### Creating a Migration

1. **Define Your Schema**: Update your `prisma/schema.prisma` file with the desired changes to your data model.

2. **Create a Migration**: Run the following command to create a new migration based on your schema changes:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>
   ```

   Replace `<migration-name>` with a descriptive name for your migration. This command will:
   - Generate a new migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory.
   - Apply the migration to your development database.

### Applying Migrations

To apply existing migrations to your database, use:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

This command is typically used in production environments to apply all pending migrations.

### Resetting the Database

If you need to reset your database and apply all migrations from scratch, use:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

This command will:
- Drop the existing database.
- Recreate the database.
- Apply all migrations.

### Generating Prisma Client

After creating or applying migrations, generate the Prisma Client to reflect the latest schema changes:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Viewing the Database

To inspect your database, you can use Prisma Studio, a visual database browser:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

### Environment Variables

All required environment variables for database configuration and other services are defined in the `.env` file. Ensure that this file is correctly set up with the necessary values before running migrations or starting the application.

### Important Considerations

- **Backup**: Always back up your data before running migrations in a production environment.
- **Version Control**: Keep your `prisma/migrations` directory under version control to track changes to your database schema.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your database schema and migrations using Prisma.
